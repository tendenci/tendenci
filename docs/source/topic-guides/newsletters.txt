Newsletters Scheduling
======================

Newsletters can be set to send immediately or schedule a later date/time to send. By default, scheduling is not enabled due to additional setup needed. To enable newsletters scheduling, follow these steps:

1. Add the setting `NEWSLETTER_SCHEDULE_ENABLED = True` to your conf/settings.py.

2. Make sure a process is started for the management command `qcluster`. On Ubuntu, you can create a qcluster service like this:

  ::

    [Unit]
    Description=Django-Q qcluster
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    WorkingDirectory=/var/www/mysite
    ExecStart=/srv/mysite/bin/python \
        /var/www/mysite/manage.py \
        qcluster

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target


Once the newsletters scheduling is enabled, you can make a schedule in the step 5 when adding a newsletter. Just check the "Schedule to Send?" checkbox, you can then specify when to send and how often to send (if needed).
