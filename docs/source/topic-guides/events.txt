Events
======


Tendenci offers robust Event management and registration capabilities. You can add events to your website to be displayed on a calendar or a list view.

Events can allow for registration. Different pricing options can be set for different levels of registration. For example, you may have

- Early Bird Rate
- Member Rate
- Member Table Rate (multiple registrants included)
- At-the-door Rate

All of these pricing options (and any others you might think up), can be configured to have a start and end time, and can be made only available members of your site or possibly only people in certain groups.

Zoom Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can setup your Event to integrate with Zoom. It will launch a meeting from the Event's page. This can be used for calculating credits (if you are using credits) or from just simply providing an easy to find location for the link to your Zoom meeting. The 'Join Meeting' button will appear on the Event's page
10 minutes prior to the Event's start date and time and will remain available until the end date and time configured in the 'Overview' section of Event edit.

To integrate with Zoom:
   1. Edit the Event and select the Location tab
   2. Click Virtual
   3. Click Use Zoom integration
   4. Select the configuration for your Zoom API (see setup for Zoom API Configuration)
   5. Enter the Meeting ID and meeting passcode for the meeting you want to launch for that Event.


If you are using credits, once Zoom meeting has finished, and it is past the Event’s end date and time, an option to Generate Zoom Credits will appear in the Event dropdown menu. Credits will be generated (if applicable) and you will be redirected to the Credit Override page in the admin.


Zoom API Configuration
----------------------
From the Admin Backend for Events, you will find Zoom API Configuration. This will allow you to integrate your Zoom account(s). Multiple accounts
can be used, but only one default can be set. The default integration will be selected on Event creation. You will be able to use another configured
account by changing your selection on Event add or on Event edit.

Use 'Account name' to give a set of Zoom credentials a name that will allow you to easily recognize it. You will need to enter the client id and secret
for your SDK app (see SDK app configuration) and your account id, client id and secret for your Server-to-Server OAuth app (see Server-to-Server OAuth app configuration)
