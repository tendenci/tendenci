Boxes
=====

Boxes are specialized areas that are added to your theme. You can add HTML content to a box via a WYSIWYG. Boxes can be included based on their ID or based on tags.

To use boxes, they must be added to your theme.

Adding Boxes to your Theme
--------------------------

Boxes can be embedded into the theme with only a couple lines of code.

.. code-block:: django
   :emphasize-lines: 1,7

   {% load boxes_tags %}

   {% block html_body %}

       ...

       {% box 1 %}

       ...

   {% endblock html_body %}

Boxes are referenced by their ID, which is visible in the admin area list of boxes.
