Upgrade 12.X to 14.0
====================

.. note:: If you have addons on your site, make sure you have your addons upgraded to be Django 3.2 LTS compatible before upgrading your site to Tendenci 14.


Step 1: Prepare for Upgrade
---------------------------

Back up your site and database!

Replace the content of the ``requirements/tendenci.txt`` with the following:
::

    tendenci>=14,<15


We recommend to create a new virtual env instead of using the existing one.


Step 2: Upgrade Tendenci
------------------------

Run:
::

    cd /var/www/mysite/
    source /srv/mysite/bin/activate
    # For production sites, run
    pip install -r requirements/prod.txt --upgrade
    # For dev sites on your local, run
    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt --upgrade
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py deploy
    python manage.py clear_cache


If you have Google reCAPTCHA set up, please rename these two settings:

    Rename `NORECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` to `RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY`

    Rename `NORECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` to `RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY`


Step 3: Upgrade System Commands
-------------------------------

Replace the virtualenv in:
    - cron jobs 
    - systemd unit file. 

After update is done, restart your site.
