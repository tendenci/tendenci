Upgrade 11.X to 12.0

Step 1: Prepare for Upgrade
---------------------------

Back up your site and database!

Replace the content of the ``requirements/tendenci.txt`` with the following:
::

    tendenci>=12,<13


For production sites, also update the content of the ``requirements/prod.txt``:
::

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tendenci/tendenci-project-template/master/requirements/prod.txt > requirements/prod.txt


Step 2: Upgrade Tendenci

Run:
::

    cd /var/www/mysite/
    source /srv/mysite/bin/activate
    # For production sites, run
    pip install -r requirements/prod.txt --upgrade
    # For dev sites on your local, run
    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt --upgrade
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py deploy
    python manage.py clear_cache
