Testing changes to Tendenci
===========================

.. note:: Please consider adding tests if **adding or fixing** code in Tendenci!

Testing during development is done via `Django style
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/testing/>`_ (Python) `unittest`
tests.

Testing can be done with the following steps and will test Tendenci as well as
the basic project.

- Install tendenci per the instructions
- Change in to the newly created site and run tests with

::

  ./manage.py test --keepdb

If coverage.py (a tool to measure the exposure of your codebase to tests) is
installed it can also be used to provide reports

::

  coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
  coverage report

Running with --keepdb is optional but speeds up Tendenci testing a lot due to
its migration heavy nature but you will need to remove it if you see problems
while running tests.

--verbosity 2 can be used to increase output during testing.

Writing tests
-------------

`Django's documentation
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial05/>`_ covers writing
tests and we recommend you look there for guidance.
