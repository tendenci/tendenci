Remote Installation
===================

Below are some instructions to create a Tendenci site on an Ubunutu server. We recommend using 12.04, though 10.04 will work as well.

Server packages
---------------

You can install all of the necessary Ubuntu packages with the following command:
::

    sudo apt-get install git python-pip postgresql build-essential python-dev libevent-dev libpq-dev openssh-server memcached libmemcached-dev libjpeg8 libjpeg-dev libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev nginx

Along with this, we need to add some symlinks for our jpeg and freetype libraries:
::

    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/`uname -i`-linux-gnu/libz.so /usr/lib
    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/`uname -i`-linux-gnu/libjpeg.so /usr/lib
    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/`uname -i`-linux-gnu/libfreetype.so /usr/lib


Creating the Tendenci site folder
---------------------------------

Go to the path on your server where you'd like to keep your site. For this example, we will use ``/var/www``. Make a folder for your site, update it's permissions, and cd into it. Replace 'sitename' with the name of your site.
::

    cd /var/www
    mkdir sitename
    chown root:www-data sitename
    chmod 755 sitename
    cd sitename

It's best practice to make a virtual environment for your site. You will need `virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_ installed for the next step. If you don't have it, you can install it with ``pip install virtualenv``. Make a virtual environment called 'venv' and activate it.
::

    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

Install Tendenci. This download and install step may take a few minutes.
::

    pip install tendenci

Once this is done, you can setup django project with the following:
::

    create-tendenci-project

Next, we install requirements for the project. We add tendenci videos as an example to use.
::

    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt


Setting up the Database
-----------------------

From here, we need to create our database. We can create a database and a new user with the following commands:
::

    psql -U postgres -c "CREATE USER tendenci WITH PASSWORD 'yourgreatpassword'";
    psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE tendenci WITH OWNER tendenci;"
    psql -U postgres -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE tendenci TO tendenci;"

This will create a database named ``tendenci`` with the user named ``tendenci``. Next we need to update our ``.env`` file in our site folder. Replace the following line:
::

    DATABASE_URL='postgres://localhost/tendenci'

with this (including your real password):
::

    DATABASE_URL='postgres://tendenci:yourgreatpassword@localhost/tendenci'


Creating the database tables
----------------------------

Along with that, we should add the folloing lines to our ``.env`` file:
::

    LOCAL_MEMCACHED_URL = '127.0.0.1:11211'
    EMAIL_HOST = 'localhost'
    EMAIL_PORT = '25'
    HAYSTACK_SEARCH_ENGINE='whoosh'
    SECRET_KEY='random_16_characters'

The ``random_16_characters`` should be replaced with a real random 16 characters.

Now we are ready to use our deploy script.
::

    python deploy.py

.. Note:: 

    If this is your first time using Tendenci, we **recommend** you install some default data and our twenty-thirteen theme to get a feel of what a full Tendenci site is like. You can install this data and theme with the command:
    ::

        python manage.py load_npo_defaults


To create your login, run the following command and fill in the prompts:
::

    python manage.py createsuperuser


Setting up Upstart
------------------

On Ubuntu, we can use the Upstart functionality to add our site as a service.

First, we create a file at the path ``/etc/init/tendenci.conf``. The contents of that file should match the example below:
::

    description "Tendenci Upstart Script"
    start on runlevel [2345]
    stop on runlevel [06]
    respawn
    respawn limit 10 5
    exec /var/www/sitename/.upstart.sh

You will need to replace the ``/var/www/sitename`` with the location of your site.

Along with this, we need to add a ``.upstart.sh`` to our site folder. This will live at ``/var/www/sitename/.upstart.sh`` or whatever the location of your path. This ``.upstart.sh`` file should match the example below:
::

    #!/bin/bash
    set -e
    cd /var/www/sitename
    . venv/bin/activate
    exec gunicorn -w 2 -b 127.0.0.1:8000 conf.wsgi

Again, replace ``/var/www/sitename`` with your real path. Next, we need to adjust the permissions on our new file:
::

    chown root:www-data /var/www/sitename/.upstart.sh
    chmod u+x /var/www/sitename/.upstart.sh

To start this service, we can use the following command:
::

    service tendenci start

If we make any changes in the future to our environment file (``.env``), we should restart our server with this command:
::

    service tendenci restart


Setting up nginx
----------------

We will need to make an nginx configuration file for our site. This will be created at ``/etc/nginx/sites-available/sitename`` and should match the example below:
::

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name localhost;

        charset   utf-8;
        keepalive_timeout  65;
        client_max_body_size  30M;

        location /static/ {
            root //var/www/sitename/;
            access_log off;
            expires 30d;
        }
     
        location /media/ {
            root /var/www/sitename/;
            access_log off;
            expires 30d;
        }

        location /themes/([a-zA-Z0-9\-\_]+)/media/ {
            root /var/www/sitename/themes/$1/media/;
            access_log off;
        }

        location / {
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000/;
        }
    }

Again, replace ``/var/www/sitename`` with your real path. If you have a domain name pointed at the server, add it to the ``server_name`` line in the place of ``localhost``.

Next, we create a symlink to our new file at ``/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/sitename`` with this command:
::

    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/sitename /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/sitename

We also recommend removing the default record from the sites-enabled with this command:
::

    rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

Finally, we restart our nginx service:
::

    service nginx restart


Setup Mail and Memcached
------------------------

For a mail server, we will install postfix. This package has 3 steps that you must respond to in order to complete the installation. If you have a domain name, you should enter it in the prompts. Otherwise, leave the defaults in place. To install the package, run this command:
::

    apt-get install postfix

Memcache was already installed at our first line. We need to turn the service on with this command:
::

    service memcached start


Load your site
--------------

You should now be able to view your site, either at the ip address of the server, or at the domain name you have setup.
