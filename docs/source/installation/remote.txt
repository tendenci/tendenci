Remote Installation
===================

Below are some instructions to create a Tendenci site on an Ubuntu server. 12.04 is recommended, though 10.04 will work as well.

All of the commands below should be run on the command line after you are connected to the server.

Server packages
---------------

You can install all of the necessary Ubuntu packages with the following commands:
::

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install git python-pip postgresql build-essential python-dev libevent-dev libpq-dev openssh-server memcached libmemcached-dev libjpeg8 libjpeg-dev libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev nginx

Along with this, add the necessary symlinks for the jpeg and freetype libraries:
::

    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/`uname -i`-linux-gnu/libz.so /usr/lib
    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/`uname -i`-linux-gnu/libjpeg.so /usr/lib
    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/`uname -i`-linux-gnu/libfreetype.so /usr/lib


Creating the Tendenci site folder
---------------------------------

Go to the path on the server where the site should be installed. For this example, use ``/var/www``. Make a folder for the site, update it's permissions, and cd into it. Replace 'sitename' with the name of the site.
::

    cd /var/www
    mkdir sitename
    chown root:www-data sitename
    chmod 755 sitename
    cd sitename

It's best practice to make a virtual environment for the site. You will need `virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_ installed for the next step. If you don't have it, you can install it with ``pip install virtualenv``. Make a virtual environment called 'venv' and activate it.
::

    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install setuptools --upgrade

Install Tendenci. This download and install step may take a few minutes.
::

    pip install tendenci

Once this is done, you can setup django project with the following:
::

    create-tendenci-project

Next, install requirements for the project.
::

    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt


Setting up the Database
-----------------------

The Postgres database server was installed as part of the step to install server packages. It is a separate application from Tendenci, but is needed as the database backend that will be used for Tendenci.

The steps to configure Postgres can be run from anywhere (i.e. you do not need to be in the tendenci folder at /var/www/sitename to configure postgres).

Change the postgres default user password as the postgres user. Lines that start postgres=# are prompts:
::

    sudo -u postgres psql postgres
    postgres=# \password postgres
    Enter new password: your-pgsql-password-here
    Enter it again: your-pgsql-password-here

Type Control+D to exit the posgreSQL prompt.

From here, create the database and a new postgres user with the following commands:
::

    sudo -u postgres psql postgres -c "CREATE USER tendenci WITH PASSWORD 'yourgreatpassword';"
    sudo -u postgres psql postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE tendenci WITH OWNER tendenci;"
    sudo -u postgres psql postgres -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE tendenci TO tendenci;"

This will create a database named ``tendenci`` with the user named ``tendenci``. Next update the ``.env`` file in the site folder (``/var/www/sitename``). First, list files with ``ls -a`` then open the file for editing with ``nano /var/www/sitename/.env`` which will allow editing of the contents. Replace the following line:
::

    DATABASE_URL='postgres://localhost/tendenci'

with this (including the real password):
::

    DATABASE_URL='postgres://tendenci:yourgreatpassword@localhost/tendenci'

Finally, save the file with Control+O and exit nano with Control+X.

Creating the database tables
----------------------------

Along with that, the following lines should be added to the ``.env`` file, using ``nano`` like in the previous step with the DATABASE_URL:
::

    LOCAL_MEMCACHED_URL = '127.0.0.1:11211'
    EMAIL_HOST = 'localhost'
    EMAIL_PORT = '25'
    HAYSTACK_SEARCH_ENGINE='whoosh'
    SECRET_KEY='random_16_characters'

The ``random_16_characters`` should be replaced with a real random 16 characters. Then save the changes to the file.

Now, use the deploy script to create the database tables and static media.
::

    python deploy.py

.. Note:: 

    If this is your first time using Tendenci, it's **recommended** to install the available default data and the twenty-thirteen theme to get a feel of what a full Tendenci site is like. You can install this data and theme with the command:
    ::

        python manage.py load_npo_defaults


To create an administrator login, run the following command and fill in the prompts:
::

    python manage.py createsuperuser


Setting up Upstart
------------------

On Ubuntu, the Upstart functionality can be used to add the site as a service.

First, create a file at the path ``/etc/init/tendenci.conf``. 
::

    cd /etc/init/
    sudo touch tendenci.conf
    
The contents of that file should match the example below:
::

    description "Tendenci Upstart Script"
    start on runlevel [2345]
    stop on runlevel [06]
    respawn
    respawn limit 10 5
    exec /var/www/sitename/.upstart.sh

You will need to replace the ``/var/www/sitename`` with the location of the site.

Along with this, create a ``.upstart.sh`` to the site folder. This will live at ``/var/www/sitename/.upstart.sh`` or whatever the location of the path. This ``.upstart.sh`` file should match the example below:
::

    #!/bin/bash
    set -e
    cd /var/www/sitename
    . venv/bin/activate
    exec gunicorn -w 2 -b 127.0.0.1:8000 conf.wsgi

Again, replace ``/var/www/sitename`` with the real path. Next, adjust the permissions on the new file:
::

    chown root:www-data /var/www/sitename/.upstart.sh
    chmod u+x /var/www/sitename/.upstart.sh

To start this service, use the following command:
::

    sudo service tendenci start

If any changes in the future are made to the environment file (``.env``), the service should be restarted with this command:
::

    sudo service tendenci restart


Setting up nginx
----------------

First, make an nginx configuration file for the site. This will be created at ``/etc/nginx/sites-available/sitename`` and should match the example below:
::

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name localhost;

        charset   utf-8;
        keepalive_timeout  65;
        client_max_body_size  30M;
        root /var/www/sitename/;

        location /static/ {
            access_log off;
            expires 30d;
        }
     
        location /media/ {
            access_log off;
            expires 30d;
        }

        location ~ /themes/([a-zA-Z0-9\-\_]+)/media/ {
            access_log off;
        }

        location / {
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000/;
        }
    }

Again, replace ``/var/www/sitename/`` with the real path. If you have a domain name like ``example.com`` pointed at the server, add it to the ``server_name`` line in the place of ``localhost``.

Next, create a symlink to the new file at ``/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/sitename`` with this command:
::

    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/sitename /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/sitename

Remove the default record from the sites-enabled with this command:
::

    rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

Finally, restart the nginx service:
::

    sudo service nginx restart


Setup Mail and Memcached
------------------------

For a mail server, install postfix. This package has 3 steps that you must respond to in order to complete the installation. If the server is alreadly configured with a domain name, enter that domain in the prompts. Otherwise, leave the defaults in place. To install the package, run this command:
::

    apt-get install postfix

Memcache was already installed at the server packages step. Turn the service on with this command:
::

    service memcached start


Load the site
--------------

The site should now be viewable, either at the ip address of the server, or at the domain name that has been setup.


Running Multiple sites on one server
------------------------------------

The process outlined above to install Tendenci can be used multiple times on a single server.

The steps to install Server Packages and the steps to replace the main postgres password do not need to be repeated.

When installing any additional Tendenci sites, replace the ``sitename`` used throughout the examples with a unique name.

When creating the database for any additional sites, be sure to use a unique database name and username. In the instructions above, the database name and username were both ``tendenci``. Change this to something unique for each site.

Each additional Tendenci site will need to run on a different port internally. In the instructions, port 8000 was used. This will be changed for additional sites in the nginx configuration file as well as the ``.upstart.sh`` file for each new site.
