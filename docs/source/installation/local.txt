Local Installation
==================

You can use the following installation instructions to install a local Tendenci site. This Django project is intended to help create a Tendenci site that you can deploy on a public hosting, but it's recommended that you install locally first in order to test your themes and designs.

Pre-config
----------

Install `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_:
::

    sudo easy_install pip

Install `virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_:
::

    pip install virtualenv

If you are using OS X, you may need to sudo that command with:
::

    sudo pip install virtualenv

You'll also need to have Git set up (see `this Github help article <https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git>`_ for instructions).

On Mac OS X 10.7 or higher you will need Xcode 4.4.1 or higher (in app store) and will need to install the Command Line tools it comes with. To install these, open Xcode, click the "Xcode" menu item in the top left of the screen near the Apple logo, then click "Preferences", then click "Downloads". Then click install on the line next to Command Line Tools.


Setting up the database
-----------------------

Tendenci is designed for use with PostgreSQL. You will need to have a PostgreSQL server running locally. If you are on OS X, we recommend `Postgres.app <http://postgresapp.com/>`_ to get up and running fast.

With Postgres.app installed, you can create a database from Terminal:
::

    psql -h localhost -c "CREATE DATABASE tendenci"

You can also create a database in your GUI of choice (recommended: `PGAdmin <http://www.pgadmin.org/>`_).

For more on installing PostgreSQL for Django check the docs at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/databases/#postgresql-notes.


Downloading Tendenci
--------------------

Make a folder for your site and cd into it. Replace 'sitename' with the name of your site.
::

    mkdir sitename
    cd sitename

It's best practice to make a virtual environment for your site. You will need `virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_ installed for the next step. If you don't have it, you can install it with ``pip install virtualenv``. Make a virtual environment called 'venv' and activate it.
::

    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

Install Tendenci. This download and install step may take a few minutes.
::

    pip install tendenci


Setting up your site
--------------------

Once this is done, you can setup django project with the following:
::

    create-tendenci-project

.. Note::

    If you created a database with a name other than 'tendenci', you will need to edit the database name 'tendenci' inside the ``.env`` file that is created.

Next, we install requirements for the project. We add tendenci videos as an example to use.
::

    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt

Now we are ready to use our deploy script.
::

    python deploy.py

.. Note:: 

    If this is your first time using Tendenci, we **recommend** you install some default data and our twenty-thirteen theme to get a feel of what a full Tendenci site is like. You can install this data and theme with the command:
    ::

        python manage.py load_npo_defaults


To create your login, run the following command and fill in the prompts:
::

    python manage.py createsuperuser

Finally, we can use the runserver command so that we can view the site in our browser:
::

    python manage.py runserver

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser to see your tendenci site!


Advanced Options
----------------

**Optional:** If you want to use a different theme, you can set that theme with the following command, replacing `my-theme-name` with the name of your theme:
::

    python manage.py set_theme my-theme-name

**Optional:** You can add additional local environment variables to the ``.env`` file by defining them as ``KEY='value'``. Settings that are sensitive (like passwords) or vary per environment should be added to this file. For example, to use Amazon's S3 service as a file storage backend, set the following key/value pairs in your ``.env`` file:
::

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='MY_ACCESS_KEY'
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='MY_SECRET_KEY'
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME='bucket_name'
    AWS_LOCATION='new-site-name'

If you are interested in deploying your site to Heroku, see our `online instructions <https://github.com/tendenci/tendenci/blob/master/docs/heroku.md>`_.
