Running and Writing Tests
==========================

.. note:: Please consider adding tests when **adding or fixing** code in Tendenci!

Test, test, test! There is no need for us to stress how important testing is - everybody knows that. 

At the current stage, both manual testing and automated testing are important.
Manual testing can not be completely replaced by automated testing.
There are many cases you would want to run manual tests.
Automated testing can help us run tests more efficiently. Therefore,
if applicable, please test thoroughly as an anonymous user, a logged-in user, a member 
and a super user, respectively, for your new features or updates to ensure they work as expected.
 

Running Tests
-------------
To run automated testing in Tendenci, just type the following command and run in your dev environment.
::

    python manage.py test tendenci
    
 
If coverage.py (a tool to measure the exposure of your codebase to tests) is
installed it can also be used to provide reports

::

  coverage run --source='tendenci' manage.py test tendenci --keepdb
  coverage report
 

Running with --keepdb is optional but speeds up Tendenci testing a lot due to
its migration heavy nature but you will need to remove it if you see problems
while running tests.

--verbosity 2 can be used to increase output during testing.

Note that when running `manage.py test` for the first time all migrations will
need to be applied to the test database. If run with --keepdb that step will be
skipped in future.


Writing Tests
-------------

Django's documentation covers writing tests and we recommend you look there for guidance `https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial05/ <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial05/>`_.

You can write your test cases in the tests.py in an app, or use the following testing structure. 
::

    app_name
        tests
             __init__.py
             test_forms.py
             test_models.py
             test_views.py
