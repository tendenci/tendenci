Events
======

Tendenci offers robust Event management and registration capabilities. You can add events to your website to be displayed on a calendar or a list view.

Events can allow for registration. Different pricing options can be set for different levels of registration. For example, you may have

- Early Bird Rate
- Member Rate
- Member Table Rate (multiple registrants included)
- At-the-door Rate

All of these pricing options (and any others you might think up), can be configured to have a start and end time, and can be made only available members of your site or possibly only people in certain groups.
