## Getting Started

If you're running Tendenci on your own local machine, feel free to clone or fork the repo. To make changes from Tendenci's browser-based Theme Editor, you can copy and paste templates. Please note that css changes currently on your site may affect the css in this template.

## Using Bootstrap 3
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) built-ins are used to create the foundation for most of the Tendenci modules in the theme.  Using Bootstrap 3 makes it possible to implement site-wide design changes instantly.  The Bootswatch CDN is used in this theme and can be removed to reveal simple Bootstrap classic templates.  Other themes from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) can also be used by changing the Bootswatch CDN in the 'base.html' file.

To add customizations on select pages, add your own unique class or id to prevent affecting the Bootstrap built-ins in other modules.

Navigate to "base.html" in your Theme Editor.

In the Bootswatch CDN link, you can change only the name of the theme to toggle through the different options!  See the image below for directions.  In this example, the 'paper' theme is used.  You can change this to any of the other [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) theme names to completely change the look of your site.
